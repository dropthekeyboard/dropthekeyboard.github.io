# A2A Animated SPA Demo Scenarios

## 1. Introduction

This document outlines the key scenarios for an animated Single Page Application (SPA) demo, illustrating the phased approach of the Agent to Agent (A2A) concept. The demo aims to visually convey how AI Agents interact with humans and other Agents across various services, leveraging communication networks.

## 2. Overall A2A Concept

The A2A vision progresses through three main phases:

- **Phase 1: A2H (Agent to Human)**: Initial stage where a customer's AI Agent interacts with a human (e.g., small business owner) primarily via universal channels like phone calls and SMS.
- **Phase 2: Lite Agent (App-based Semi-automation)**: An intermediate stage where a Lite Agent (often app-based) assists the human, enabling semi-automated interactions and integrating with partner services.
- **Phase 3: Full A2A (Agent to Agent)**: The ultimate stage where customer Agents and merchant Agents directly communicate and negotiate to complete tasks end-to-end, providing hyper-personalized and seamless experiences.

## 3. Demo Scenarios - Phase 1: A2H (Agent to Human)

### Scenario 1.1: Restaurant Reservation (Call & SMS Fallback)

**Description**: A customer asks their Agent to make a restaurant reservation. If the restaurant owner doesn't answer the call, the system automatically falls back to SMS, allowing the owner to respond with simple numerical inputs.
**User Flow**:

1.  **Customer**: "Book a table for 2 at the Italian restaurant tonight at 7 PM."
2.  **Customer Agent**: Initiates a phone call to the restaurant.
3.  **Restaurant Owner**: Does not answer the call.
4.  **System (Network Level)**: Automatically sends an SMS to the owner: "Customer requested a reservation for 8/31 at 7 PM. Is this available? Reply 1 for yes, 2 for no, 3 for alternative time."
5.  **Restaurant Owner**: Replies "3 8pm" (suggesting 8 PM).
6.  **System**: Parses the SMS reply and informs the Customer Agent.
7.  **Customer Agent**: Notifies customer: "7 PM is not available, but 8 PM is. Would you like to change?"
8.  **Customer**: "Yes, change to 8 PM."
9.  **Customer Agent**: Confirms the reservation and sends a calendar invite.

### Scenario 1.2: Care Call (Daily Check-in & Emergency Call)

**Description**: An Agent makes daily check-in calls to an elderly person. Based on their response, it can trigger an emergency call to a guardian or hospital.
**User Flow**:

## 4. Demo Scenarios - Phase 2: Lite Agent (App-based Semi-automation)

### Scenario 2.1: Restaurant Reservation (A.Biz App Integration)

3.  **Customer**: "Yes, 8 PM."
4.  **Lite Agent**: Confirms reservation via CatchTable API. Customer receives CatchTable points/benefits.
5.  **Customer Agent**: Recognizes context: "This restaurant has a CatchTable promotion for a free dessert this week. Confirm?"
